## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

## Time Taken

It took me about 1.5 h to do this.
The challenge was pretty easy. As you can see I added some validation to this and some snackbars, hope you like them. :)

I didn't insist too much on design as I thought this is not the main scope for this challenge.
